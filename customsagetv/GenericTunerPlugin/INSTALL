Build the plugin:

1. make

Install the plugin:

1. cp GenericTunerPlugin.so /opt/sagetv/server/irtunerplugins/
2. Read README and gentuner.README
3. Examine the gentuner.* scripts to see which one is the closest
   to your setup. You may need to customize one of the scripts
   to suite your setup. It would be a good idea to test your 
   version of gentuner with your setup directly from the
   command line to make sure it's working before trying it
   with Sage. You could try things like:
       "gentuner REMOTES", or
       "gentuner KEYS REMOTE_NAME_HERE", or
       "gentuner CAN_TUNE REMOTE_NAME_HERE", or
       "gentuner SEND REMOTE_NAME_HERE OK", or
       "gentuner TUNE REMOTE_NAME_HERE OK", etc
4. cp gentuner.YOURS /opt/sagetv/server/gentuner
5. Stop and start SageTV
6. In SageTV, go to the source setup for the tuner that will
   use the tuning plugin connected to this STB and click on
   "Tuner Control".
7. Click "Change Tuning Device" - you should see the name of
   the remotes your gentuner script reports. Select it.

Notes:
Currently debugging is enabled and lots of stuff will get logged to
/opt/sagetv/server/gentuner.log. You can disable that in the source
if desired. An option will be added later.
