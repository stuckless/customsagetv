Build the plugin:

1. make

Install the plugin:

1. cp GenericTunerPlugin.so /opt/sagetv/server/irtunerplugins/
2. Read README
3. Examine the sample gentuner.* scripts to see which one most closely
   fits in with your tuning needs, and make a copy. For example:
   cp gentuner.LIRC gentuner.LOCAL
4. Modify gentuner.LOCAL as needed for your environment and/or
   tuning needs.
5. Test your version of gentuner with your setup directly from the
   command line to make sure it's tuning the devices as expected
   before trying it with Sage. You could try things like:
       "gentuner.LOCAL REMOTES", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL KEYS REMOTE_NAME_HERE", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL CAN_TUNE REMOTE_NAME_HERE", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL SEND REMOTE_NAME_HERE OK", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL TUNE REMOTE_NAME_HERE OK", etc
4. cp gentuner.LOCAL /opt/sagetv/server/gentuner
5. Stop and start SageTV
6. In SageTV, go to the source setup for the tuner that will
   use the tuning plugin connected to this STB and click on
   "Tuner Control".
7. Click "Change Tuning Device" - you should see the name of
   the remotes your gentuner script reports. Select it.

Notes:
Currently debugging is enabled and lots of stuff will get logged to
/opt/sagetv/server/gentuner.log. You can disable that in the source
if desired. An option will be added later.
