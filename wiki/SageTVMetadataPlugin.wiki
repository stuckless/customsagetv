= Introduction =

This is an experimental plugin that is utilizes SageTV's MediaFileMetadataParser plugin interface.  When installed, it will do a metadata lookup each time a new media file is added to your library. 

= Installation =
Download the zip and unzip at the root of the SageTV server directory.  When you unzip, it should put some jars in the JARs directory, and it should create a file call Sage.properties.metadataupdater.

Once you unzip, check the JARs directory, and remove any duplicate jar files that have different versions.  For example, if you see sagex.api-6.4.8-11.jar and sagex.api-6.4.8-9.jar, then remove the -9 version of the Jar file.  Having more than one version of jar file in the directory will be very troublesome.

The Sage.properties.metadataupdater is the property that you need to update/edit in the Sage.properties.

To update the Sage.properties, *shut down SageTV*, then edit the Sage.properties.  Merge the property from the Sage.properties.metadataupdater into the core Sage.properties.

{{{
mediafile_metadata_parser_plugins=org.jdna.sage.MetadataUpdaterPlugin
}}}

If you have an existing metadata.properties, then copy that file to the sagetv server root directory (ie, same directory where Sage.properties exists)

Start SageTV, add a new movie, and then tell SageTV to refresh.  If your movie was automatically found, then it should appear with the appropriate thumbnail and properties.

Good luck, and you can post any comments/problems to the SageTV thread for the [http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34301 Batch Metadata Tools].
