#summary IMDB Metadata Providers

= Introduction =
There are currently 2 IMDB Providers.  Both offer different levels of functionality, but it recommened that you use the default one.


= Default IMDB Provdider (imdb) =
This provider will ONLY parse the IMDB Title page.  Because of this it is faster, but it the actor list will not be complete, since IMDB only shows a summary on the title screen.

This plugin can detect exact matches and popular matches.  Because of this, the tool can select a good match if the --auto is enabled, which it is by default.

= Nielm's IMDB Provider (nielm_imdb) =
This provider will fetch more detailed plots and a more detailed list of actors, BUT it does not fetch Directors, Writers, Aspect Ratio or Studio.  I started out using this provider, but later switched to building a new one, since I needed/wanted the additional details.
