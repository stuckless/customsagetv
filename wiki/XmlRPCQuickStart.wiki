#summary Xml RPC for SageTV api

Before you begin, ensure that you have installed the latest sages-api jar on the SageTV server.

If you have configured the server correctly, then you can test if you have basic access, by going to the url: http://localhost:9999/sagex/rpcXml/Global/GetOS

If you get back an xml file that contains the OS of the Sage server, then you are up and running.

== Anatomy of an Xml Request ==

The Xml Request has the following structure...

http://server:9999/sagex/rpcXml/SageAPI/SageCommand/Arg1/Arg2/.../context:CONTEXT

SageAPI is one of the Top Level Sage API classes in the sage.api package from their [http://download.sage.tv/api/index.html?sage/api/Global.html javadoc].  (case matters)

SageCommand is one of the Methods associated with the SageAPI (case matters)

Arg1..Argn are the parameters (position matters)

context:CONTEXT is how you can pass a UI context


When executing Xml RPC commands, it's a good idea to find your command in the SageTV JavaDoc and the convert that Java Command into Xml.
