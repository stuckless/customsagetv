These scrapers are taken from the Xbmc Project (http://xbmc.svn.sourceforge.net/)

This project will collect the scrapers from the project from time to time, so if you plan on adding new scrapers, 
fixing exsiting ones, then you should do that in the original xbmc project.

Thanks to Xbmc Team for creating these scraper definitions and making them available.
