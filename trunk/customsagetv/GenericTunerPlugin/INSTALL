Build the plugin:

1. make

Install the plugin:

IMPORTANT NOTE: After shutting down the SageTV process, always
create a backup copy of your Sage.properties file before making
any changes! If you make any changes to Sage.properties that
break your setup, you can always revert to the backup copy.

1. cp GenericTunerPlugin.so /opt/sagetv/server/irtunerplugins/
2. Read README
3. Examine the sample gentuner.* scripts to see which one most closely
   fits in with your tuning needs, and make a copy. For example:
   cp gentuner.LIRC gentuner.LOCAL
4. Modify gentuner.LOCAL as needed for your environment and/or
   tuning needs.
5. Test your version of gentuner with your setup directly from the
   command line to make sure it's tuning the devices as expected
   before trying it with Sage. You could try things like:
       "gentuner.LOCAL REMOTES", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL KEYS REMOTE_NAME_HERE", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL CAN_TUNE REMOTE_NAME_HERE", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL SEND REMOTE_NAME_HERE OK", or
       "gentuner.LOCAL TUNE REMOTE_NAME_HERE OK", etc
6. Copy your version of gentuner to where the plugin can find it:
        cp gentuner.LOCAL /opt/sagetv/server/gentuner
7. Configure each video source to use the Generic Tuner Plugin.
   Unfortunately, SageTV does not provide an easy way to change
   the tuning plugin for a video souce after the source is 
   initially configured. Your options are:
   7a. Remove the video source and re-add it, selecting "Generic
       Tuner" when asked to select a tuning plugin. Note that removing
       and re-adding the video source will likely involve other work to
       get the configuration back to where you had it.
   7b. After stopping the SageTV process, edit the Sage.properties
       file and change the appropriate "tuning_plugin" value to be:
         /opt/sagetv/server/irtunerplugins/GenericTunerPlugin.so
8. Stop and start SageTV
9. In SageTV, go to the Setup -> Setup Video Sources menu, select the
   video source that uses the Generic Tuner, click on "Tuner Control",
   then "Change Tuning Device". You should see the list of the
   remotes your gentuner script reports. Select it.

Notes:
Currently debugging is enabled and lots of stuff will get logged to
/opt/sagetv/server/gentuner.log. You can disable that in the source
if desired. An option will be added later.
